## The intersection of gender, race, and education 

1. We are interested in this topic because each of these subjects are systemic issues in our world today. Since diversity is one of the key topics we currently discuss in society, we are starting to wonder how education is equally  distributed in terms of race and gender outside of the university. Analyzing datasets that demonstrate this intersection will help us understand that intersection.
